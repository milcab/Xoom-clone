# Milca Transfer App

This an application that provides P2P transactions over the wire.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# What missing

- I see bugs
- Redirect pages to the login page based on authentication
- splitting the transaction page into send and request
- showing transctions as activities
- notifying the receipient of the transaction
- provide recepients with a way to register to the app
- mimic a bank account to keep balance and update as transactions happen
- THERE LOTS OF BUGS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
